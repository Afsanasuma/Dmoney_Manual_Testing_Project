# Project Titel: Dmoney Manual testing 

## Project Summary: I have done this project for two features. I have written acceptance criteria for both features on a rule-based standard. For feature No.1 I have written 9 acceptance criteria. Divided this feature into two modules and wrote 17 positive and negative test cases. Module's name is Paybill and Cashback. For feature No.2 I have written 5 acceptance criteria. Module name is Applying Loan and  wrote 13 positive and negative test cases. I have found 8 bug and improvement.


### feature No.1: 
In an MFS mobile app named EasyPay, customers can pay any merchant or utility bill. For each payment, a 1% service charge will be deducted from the customer's balance, with a minimum transaction fee of 5 tk. If a customer has already made transactions totaling 5000 tk for a month, s/he will receive a 20% cashback for any subsequent payments upto 5000 tk. Moreover, if the customer has already completed transactions totaling 10000 tk or more for a month, s/he will receive maximum 30% cashback. For example: If a customer paid 5000 tk, he will receive 1000 tk cashback. If a customer paid 10000 tk or more, s/he will receive 3000 tk cashback.


### feature No.2:
If a customer has a balance of less than 100 tk, s/he can apply for a loan of up to 20000 tk. If the customer repays the loan within 30 days from the loan initiation day, no interest will be charged. However, if the customer fails to repay within this period, a daily interest of 1.8% will be applied in a compound interest manner on the remaining amount.Additionally, if a customer has already paid 50% of the remaining payment, they are eligible to apply for another loan.
